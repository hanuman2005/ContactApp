# 📇 ContactApp  

ContactApp is a reimagined way to manage human connections.  
Not just an address book—think of it as a **relationship OS**.  

---

## 🚀 Why ContactApp?  
- Break free from boring contact lists.  
- Blend utility with design: fast, intuitive, human.  
- Create a foundation for extensions (AI, social graphs, smart reminders).  

---

## ✨ Features (current + future vision)  
- [x] Project initialized  
- [ ] Add / edit / delete contacts  
- [ ] Tagging & grouping (friends, work, mentors)  
- [ ] Smart search (by memory clue, not just name)  
- [ ] AI-powered insights: “You haven’t spoken to X in 3 months”  
- [ ] Cloud sync & offline resilience  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (planned)  
- **Frontend:** React Native / Flutter (cross-platform edge)  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB (flexible, schema-light)
